# About Me
Joshua Eisenstat (they/them) is a sociologist who works at the intersection of social movement studies, feminist science and technology studies, and qualitative methods. Their research focuses on two major topics. First, how activists strategize to transform and democratize elite philanthropic institutions. Second, how sociologists approach the creative and politicized teaching of research methods. 

They are currently completing their dissertation, a study of political experiments and conflicts in the field of American Jewish philanthropy.
